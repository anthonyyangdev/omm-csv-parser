# Parse OMM CSV

> A csv filter tool for the csv downloaded from Canvas for CS 3110 TAs and sections.

## Requirements

In the spirit of CS3110, this project was written in OCaml and thus requires
OCaml to build the executable. However, a transpiled Node.js version is also
available in the `node` directory in case OCaml is not obtainable.

### For OCaml users

This will assume that you've already installed opam and configured it for your machine.
You will also need Python3 to run the `setup.py` file.

```sh
opam install dune csv # js_of_ocaml (* not required unless you want to transpile the OCaml code to JS. *)
```

### For Node users

You will need to install Node of version at least 12.

## Installation for OCaml users

The Makefile contains a script to copy the executable into the /usr/local/bin
directory on Posix machines or the C:\\Windows\\System32\\ folder on Windows.

```sh
make exe_path
```

## Other Usages

```sh
# Remove generated files from the Makefile.
make clean

# Generates the node scripts
make node

# Generates the executable using dune.
make exe
```
