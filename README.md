# Parse OMM CSV

> A csv filter tool for the csv downloaded from Canvas for CS 3110 TAs and sections.

## Requirements

In the spirit of CS3110, this project was written in OCaml and thus requires
OCaml to build the executable. However, a transpiled Node.js version is also
available in the `node` directory.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install --save parse_survey
```

## Usage

```js
var parseSurvey = require('parse_survey');
parseSurvey();
```
